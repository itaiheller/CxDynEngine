Fixed
[X] Handle Cx session timeout
[X] AWS Describe instance failure causes scan lost - add retry 
[X] ScanRequest dates may fail unmarshalling if they don't contain 3 millisec digits

[ ] cxManagerURL is logged incorrectly
[ ] Launching multiple scans on startup, exceeds limits
[ ] Nullpointer when cancel scan from CxPortal
